# System Description

The whole system can be divided in to three parts:
1.	Enterprise Tier
2.	Application Tier
3.	Client Tier

###### System Architecture

##### 1.	Enterprise Tier: 
It's consist of MySQL database to store all the tweet data and ***MongoDB*** for Inverted indexes.
MySQL stores all the information like tweets text, tweets posted date, classifier output i.e. whether the given tweet contain traffic information or not. Overall, it act as a backbone of our system having following ER diagram.

***MongoDB*** used for the search purpose in our application, it stores the Inverted Index. An Inverted Index consists of a list of all the different words that appear in tweets, and for every word, a group of the records (tweets) in which it appears. This design allows to do fast full-text searches.

##### 2.	Enterprise Tier: 
It consists of protocols that focus on inter-process communication through an IP network to provide robust communication interface for end-user services. 
This layer serve the all HTTP requests generated by users utilizing ***django framework***. In addition, application logic like classifier algorithms, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and batch jobs to extract the twitter data.

##### 3. Client Tier

The client tier is an application running on the clientsâ€™ desktop, mobile or laptop that is connecting directly through HTTP to the application server.  That application is build-using HTML5 with responsive design. Therefore, a single web page can run on multiple devices of different sizes.
